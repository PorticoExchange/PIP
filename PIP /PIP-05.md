# PIP-05: Core Lightning as Motto

`optional`  `draft` `author:22388oo`

## Why Core Lightning?

"Core Lightning" could potentially refer to the Lightning Network, which is a second-layer solution built on top of certain blockchain networks (such as Bitcoin) to enable faster and cheaper transactions. The Lightning Network is designed to alleviate the scalability issues faced by many blockchain systems. It does so by creating off-chain payment channels where multiple transactions can occur before the final settlement is recorded on the main blockchain.

Using "Core Lightning" as a motto might imply a focus on the fundamental principles and the core technology behind the Lightning Network, emphasizing its importance and impact on blockchain scalability and efficiency.

## Implementation

       HTLC stands for Hash Time-Locked Contracts, which is a critical component of the Lightning Network. HTLCs ensure secure and trustless transactions within the Lightning Network. They work by using cryptographic hashes and time locks to enable conditional payments, where the recipient must produce the correct pre-image of a hash within a specified timeframe to claim the funds.

Using "Potential with HTLC" as a motto could highlight the powerful possibilities that Hash Time-Locked Contracts offer within the Lightning Network. It may emphasize the security, flexibility, and innovative potential of HTLCs in enabling instant, low-cost, and private transactions.
