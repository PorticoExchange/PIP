## Why use RGB and Taproot Assets?

Taproot Assets (formerly Taro) is a new Taproot-powered protocol for issuing assets on the bitcoin blockchain that can be transferred over the Lightning Network for instant, high volume, low fee transactions. At its core, Taproot Assets taps into the security and stability of the bitcoin network and the speed, scalability, and low fees of Lightning.

RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin & lightning network. They embrace concepts of private & mutual ownership, abstraction and separation of concerns and represent "post-blockchain", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of "tokens".

## Using cross-assets between Lightning and layers

Both the protocol use Taproot nd commit transactions for allow mint, send, receive using UTXO also as complementary

Both layers are compatible with Atomic swap and submarine swaps

## Exmple for Taproot Assets
