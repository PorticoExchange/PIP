`optional`  `draft` `author:22388oo`

## Why use RGB?


RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin & lightning network. They embrace concepts of private & mutual ownership, abstraction and separation of concerns and represent "post-blockchain", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of "tokens".

## Using cross-assets between Lightning and layers

The protocol use OP_RETURN and commit transactions for allow mint, send, receive using UTXO also as complementary

The layers are compatible with Atomic swap and submarine swap

## Example with RGB


```json
"input":"xxx"
"output":"xxxx"
"op":"xxxx"
"state":"xxxx"
"locktime":"xxxx"
```
