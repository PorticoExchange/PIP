# PIP-08: Ark

`optional`  `draft` `author:22388oo`

## What is Ark?

Ark is a second-layer solution designed to help scale Bitcoin transactions by using a shared utxo model that enables anonymous, off-chain payments through an untrusted intermediary called the Ark Service Provider (ASP). ASPs are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similar to how Lightning service providers work. 

## Implementation
